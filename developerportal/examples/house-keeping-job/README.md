# House Keeping Job - Data Backup [Under Construction]

Following scheduled job backups data `Theme`, `User`, `Collaboration` and `Core` of Developer Portal.

To move the Shell script into a job, we must change in Shell script ...

* Evaluate the post and port of Developer Portal.
* Evaluate the administrator password.
* We need a container image with `curl` and `jq`.
* The backup zip file should be saved on a persistent volume. A persistent volume should be mounted.
